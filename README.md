## Conjoined Tree Data Structure

The Conjoined Twin Tree (Conjoined Twin Tree) is a graph data structure that comprises two distinct roots and branches, 
yet shares the same leaves. This data structure is specifically designed to represent shareable or intersecting matrix 
data between the two axes, akin to a pivot table. The primary advantage of the Conjoined Twin Tree data structure lies 
in its ability to facilitate structure modifications, such as adding, inserting, deleting, sorting, filtering, and 
swapping elements on either rows or columns within the pivot table. Furthermore, the Conjoined Twin Tree enables the 
reordering of items without the necessity of reordering them along its axis. For instance, when sorting one of the 
column values within a pivot table, the corresponding values along the axis will automatically follow suit, eliminating 
the need for manual rearrangement.

The current implementation in this git repo is an implementation of Conjoined Twin Tree data structure which is a 
Conjoined Tree that contains 2 roots. This data structure is used to represent a pivot table. However, I welcome anyone
to contribute any N-number of Conjoined Tree data structure implementation in different programming language.
